### Troubleshooting :confused:
#### The Sensor isn't turning the LEDs on, but the board has power.
1. Make sure the Arduino board is connected to computer via data transfer USB cable
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Tools -> Serial Monitor
4. Check the insturction prompt the Serial Monitor
5. Completely cover the sensor with your hand & then remove your hand from the sensor to see if it detects anything.
If nothing happens, please check the connections
